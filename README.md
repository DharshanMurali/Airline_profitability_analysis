# Business Challenge: 
An airline is facing profitability pressures due to increasing operational costs driven by factors like rising fuel prices, stricter environmental regulations, and a tight labor market. To address this, the goal is to enhance the occupancy rates of the flights and optimize pricing strategies to increase the average profit per seat.

# Objective:
1.	Increase Occupancy Rate: Maximize revenue by filling more seats on low-performing flights.
2.	Improve Pricing Strategy: Adjust prices based on market conditions and customer preferences to attract more passengers.
3.	Enhance Customer Experience: Provide a seamless journey to boost customer loyalty and differentiate from competitors.

# Data Analysis Approach:

1.	Basic Analysis:
 * Fleet Insights:
    - Analyzed aircraft with over 100 seats, tracking ticket bookings and total revenue over time.
    - This revealed trends in customer behavior and pricing effectiveness across different fare conditions.
 * Trend Identification:
    - Visualized ticket booking trends using line charts, noting a steady increase in bookings with specific peak periods.
    - This pattern closely mirrored revenue trends, emphasizing the direct relationship between bookings and revenue.

2.  Punctuality Analysis:
 * Delay Distribution:
    - Analyzed scheduled vs. actual arrival delays to understand punctuality performance.
    - This insight helps in evaluating operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

3.  Occupancy Rate Analysis:
 * Revenue Metrics:
    - Assessed total revenue and average revenue per ticket per aircraft.
    - The SU9 aircraft emerged as the top revenue generator, primarily due to its lower fare prices in both business and economy classes.
    - Conversely, the CN1 aircraft showed the least revenue, potentially due to offering only economy class at very low prices, possibly reflecting poor conditions or fewer amenities.
 * Occupancy Insights:
    - Calculated the average occupancy rate by comparing booked seats to total available seats per aircraft.
    - Findings indicated that higher occupancy rates directly correlated with increased profitability.
    - A simulation showed that a 10% increase in occupancy could significantly enhance annual revenue, underscoring the importance of effective pricing and operational strategies.

4.	Pricing Strategy:
  *	Fare Comparison:
    - Generated bar graphs comparing average charges for different fare conditions across various aircraft.
    - Business class fares were consistently higher across all aircraft, suggesting a pricing structure that could be optimized further to balance affordability and revenue generation.

5.	Route Performance Analysis:
  * Profitability Insights:
    - Identified the most and least profitable routes, providing a basis for optimizing route planning and resource allocation to maximize revenue

# Key Insights:
•	Occupancy Rate Influence: 
  - Higher occupancy rates lead to better revenue and profitability. 
  - By targeting low-performing flights and adjusting pricing strategies, significant financial gains can be achieved.
•	Revenue Optimization: 
  - Pricing needs to be carefully balanced—neither too high nor too low. 
  - Aircraft with lower fares in better condition drew more passengers, indicating the need to align pricing with aircraft quality and service offerings.
•	Strategic Recommendations: 
  - Airlines should consider revising fares for each aircraft type, ensuring prices reflect the aircraft's condition and customer demand. 
  - Additionally, increasing occupancy should be a priority, but not at the expense of customer satisfaction or safety.

# Outcome: 
  - This project provided a comprehensive analysis of the airline’s current pricing and occupancy strategies, offering actionable insights to boost profitability.
  - By implementing the recommended changes, the airline can improve its competitive edge while maintaining high service standards.
